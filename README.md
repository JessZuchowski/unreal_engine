I'm learning Unreal Engine 4 and will start with some tutorials before moving onto my own games.

The first tutorial I'm following is by [Devslopes,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJpfLkEsoek) making a simple FPS using Blueprints.

The second will be [Devslopes,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dl91ORwmy8) Unreal Engine beginner C++ tutorial.

Following another C++ tutorial, this one by Raywenderlich called [CoinCollector.](https://www.raywenderlich.com/185-unreal-engine-4-c-tutorial#toc-anchor-000)
